## Preferences ‚öô

- __*extra-info*__

- __*terminal*__
  The terminal program to use when performing the `Show Logs`, `Watch Top`, `Open Shell`, and `Watch Statistics`

  Tested values:
  | value | notes |
  | ----- | ----- |
  |__*gnome-terminal --*__| default terminal program for all gnome version till 46, inclusive |
  |__*ptyxis --*__| default terminal program for gnome version from 47 onward |
  |__*kitty*__| no extra arguments needed |
  |__*flatpak run app.studiodev.Ptyxis --*__| Some flatpak environments doesn't have podman on the path |

  Note: The value for __*terminal*__ may not work for you. Please report any working value you have so in time we would have a proper list.
  There is a system wide gsettings `org.gnome.desktop.default-applications.terminal exec` but depending on the value different args are needed, as seen from above.
